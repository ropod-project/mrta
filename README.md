# Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA)

Allocates tasks with temporal constraints and uncertain durations to a multi-robot system.

Includes three allocation algorithms:
- Temporal-sequential single item auctions (TeSSI)[1]. 
- Temporal-sequential single item auctions with degree of strong controllability (TeSSI-DSC) (based on [1] and [3]).
- Temporal-sequential single item auctions with static robust execution (TeSSI-SREA) (based on [1] and [2])
 
Each robot maintains a temporal network with its tasks.
The temporal network is either a:
- Simple Temporal Network (STN)
- Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainties (STNU)
- Probabilistic Simple Temporal Network (PSTN)

The temporal network represents a Simple Temporal Problem (STP).

The [mrta_stn](https://github.com/anenriquez/mrta_stn/) repository includes the temporal
network models and solvers for the STP.


The system consists of a fms (fleet managements system), a robot proxy and a robot instance per physical robot in the fleet.

Brief description of the components:

### FMS: 
- Gets tasks' plan from pickup to delivery and adds it to the task.
- Requests the auctioneer to allocate tasks
 
#### Auctioneer
- Announces unallocated tasks to the robot proxies in the local network, opening an allocation round.
- Receives bids from the robot bidders.
- Elects a winner per allocation round or throws an exception indicating that no allocation was possible in the current round.

#### Dispatcher
- Gets earliest task and checks schedulability condition (a task is schedulable x time before its start time).
- Adds action between current robot's position and the task's pickup location.
- Dispatches a task queue to the schedule execution monitor. 

#### Timetable Monitor
- Receives task-status messages 
- Updates the corresponding robot's timetable accordingly and triggers recovery measures if necessary. 

#### Fleet Monitor
- Update robot's positions based on robot-pose messages.

#### PerformanceTracker
- Updates performance metrics during allocation, scheduling and execution

#### Simulator
- Controls simulation time using [simpy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### RobotProxy
Acts on behalf of the robot

#### Bidder
- Receives task announcements.
- Computes a bid per task received in the task announcement. Bid calculation is dependant of the allocation method.
- Sends its best bid to the auctioneer.

#### Timetable Monitor
- Same as the timetable monitor, but only updates the robot's proxy timetable.

### Robot
Physical robot (in this case, just a mockup)

#### Schedule Monitor
- Receives a task queue and schedules the first task in the queue.
- Sends the task to the executor. 
- Receives task-status messages from the executor and monitors the execution of the task.
- Triggers recovery measures in case the current task violates the temporal constraints and the next task is at risk. 

#### Executor
- Determines the duration of actions based on a duration graph (travel time based on historical information) and sends task-status msgs.

#### API:
- Provides middleware functionality

#### ccu_store
- interface to interact with the ccu db

#### robot_store
- interface to interact with the robot db

#### robot_proxy_store
- interface to interact with the robot proxy db

Available approaches are specified in mrs/config/default/approaches.yaml

## Using Docker

[Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

[Install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Go to `mrs/tests` and run
```
python3 run.py approach_name

```

Example:

python3 run.py tessi-dsc-corrective-preempt
```

## Without Docker

Install the repositories

-  [mrta_stn](https://github.com/anenriquez/mrta_stn)

- [ropod_common](https://github.com/ropod-project/ropod_common)


Get the requirements:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Add the task_allocation to your `PYTHONPATH` by running:

```
pip3 install --user -e .
```

Open a terminal per robot proxy and run

```
python3 robot_proxy.py ropod_001 --approach approach_name
```

Open a terminal per robot and run

```
python3 robot.py ropod_001 --approach approach_name
```

Run in another terminal

```
python3 ccu.py  --approach approach_name
```

Go to `/tests` and run test in another terminal
```
python3 test.py --approach approach_name
```
